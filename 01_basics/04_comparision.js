/*
//EASY and pretictable

/* Comparision between different datatypes  
=> Not recommended as it is not pretictable , results sometimes may vary 
As you can see below in case of null 
*/

// console.log("2" > 1)
// console.log("02" > 1)

/* console.log(null > 0);
console.log(null == 0);
console.log(null >= 0); */ //Prints true whooh -> Reason operators works differently


// === => Checks the value strictly 

console.log("2" === 2); //Prints false since datatype is not same
